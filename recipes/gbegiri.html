        <li> Add the peeled beans into a pot, place on a hob on high heat.</li>
        <li> Add water and cook till very soft and mushy. Be careful not to add too much water, You can start with 2 cups and add as you go, if necessary. Do not add salt.</li>
        <li>Use an Ijabe (Ewedu broom) to mash up the beans or a whisk. Save time and energy by blending till smooth in your jug blender. If you’re using a blender, be sure to wait till the beans has cooled down a bit before blending so you don’t risk damaging your blender. Add water to the beans before blending, not too much though, say half a cup.</li>
        <li>Now, return the paste back into the pot and on low heat this time around. You might need to add a bit of water to the paste.The consistency should be semi- fluid.</li>
        <li>Add the palm oil, Iru, crayfish powder, Knorr cube, ground pepper and salt to taste. Be careful not to add too much Palm oil, you only need a little to slightly alter the colour of the paste.</li>
