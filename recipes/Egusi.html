        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <h3>For the stock</h3>

        <ul>

        <li>In a medium pot, combine beef, onion, crayfish, salt, pepper, and 6 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li> Lower heat to maintain a simmer and cook until the stock is slightly reduced and the beef is mostly tender.</li>
        <li>In about 45 minutes (the beef will tenderize further when cooked in the soup). Using a slotted spoon, remove beef and transfer to a medium heatproof bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Reserve stock (you should have about 5 1/2 cups).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the egusi</h3>

        <ul>
        <li>In a food processor or countertop blender, process onion, pepper (if using), and 1/4 cup water until smooth.</li>
        <li>Scrape into a medium bowl and stir in the ground egusi seeds. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until a thick, creamy paste has formed (paste should be viscous and hold its shape)</li>
        <li>Set aside in a 4-quart saucepan, heat oil over low heat for 1 minute. Slowly add all of the reserved stock, along with the crayfish, and bring to a gentle simmer. </li>
        <li>Add paste, 1 heaped teaspoon at a time, to stock. Cover and cook, stirring and gently scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally, until all of the paste is firm and crumbly.</li>
        <li>In about 25 minutes (patches of orange-red palm oil may bubble on top or around the sides).</li>
        <li>Add reserved beef and stir gently to break up the cooked paste into curds (stirring more or less affects the size of the curds).</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to cook until beef is heated through and tender, and some of the orange-red palm oil pools on top, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mound pumpkin leaves and waterleaf on top of soup without stirring, then cover and let steam until greens are wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in wilted greens.</li>
        <li>Add bitter leaf and cook until soft, about 8 minutes. Divide soup among warmed bowls and serve hot or at room temperature with eba, dodo, or cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>
